<h2>Reflections :):):)</h2>

 <h2> Day 6 Reflection</h2>
 <p> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that within both programs you have to call functions before actually implementing them. In python however 
  it's important to save your work everytime. I believe that Python is a harder program to use because you have to manually type in what function and code
  you want to happen instead of simply dragging buttons into "if then" statements. </p>
 
 <h3> Day 7 Refelection</h3>
 <p> I believe that today was relatively successful in the sense that my partner and I actually were able to get our program on python to do what we wanted it to do.
  This project was really fun because we were able to add a lot of user input and really create a story for the user to go through. </p>
 
 <h4> Day 8 Reflection</h4>
 <p> A list is essentially an ordered group of values that can be called upon. This is useful because it acts as a strong skill in computer sciene
  that aids you in problem solving. I feel like working in pairs is easier because it allows you to work really closely with one person so if you 
  have a really big problem you can get a direct answer and really work to solve it. </p>
  
  <h5> Day 9 Reflection</h5>
  <p> Overall I really enjoyed the field trip to Refinery29 because I thought it was a cool opportunity to experience an environment we could
  possibly work in in the future if we take up a career in computer science. The people were also really interactive and helpful. </p>
  
  <h6> Day 10 Reflection</h6>
  <p> Today I was able to learn that there are a lot of aspects of coding and computer science in robotics. Without programming your circuit, it wouldn't be able to
  do anything. I'm really excited to see how we will move into more advanced forms of robotics but I'm also really nervous in seeing
  how well I would do in it. Working in groups is really beneficial because we're able to divide the work evenly and work efficiently. It also 
  helps to refer to your group when you encounter something you really don't know. </p>
  
  <h6> Day 11 Reflection</h6>
  <p> One glow that I feel that my group experienced while testing out the sensors and blinking LED lights would be that we all worked together. Since there was
  only three of us it made it easier to split the work and during the hands on session it made it easier to really tackle the wiring 
  in a smart way. One grow would be that it would have been easier if we all communicated constantly but overall we worked very well together.
