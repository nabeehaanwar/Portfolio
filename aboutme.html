 <h2> Day 6 Reflection</h2>
 <p> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that within both programs you have to call functions before actually implementing them. In python however 
  it's important to save your work everytime. I believe that Python is a harder program to use because you have to manually type in what function and code
  you want to happen instead of simply dragging buttons into "if then" statements. </p>
