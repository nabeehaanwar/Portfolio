 <h2> Day 6 Reflection</h2>
 <p> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that within both programs you have to call functions before actually implementing them. In python however 
  it's important to save your work everytime. I believe that Python is a harder program to use because you have to manually type in what function and code
  you want to happen instead of simply dragging buttons into "if then" statements. </p>
 
 <h3> Day 7 Refelection</h3>
 <p> I believe that today was relatively successful in the sense that my partner and I actually were able to get our program on python to do what we wanted it to do.
  This project was really fun because we were able to add a lot of user input and really create a story for the user to go through. </p>
 
 <h4> Day 8 Reflection</h4>
 <p> A list is essentially an ordered group of values that can be called upon. This is useful because it acts as a strong skill in computer sciene
  that aids you in problem solving. I feel like working in pairs is easier because it allows you to work really closely with one person so if you 
  have a really big problem you can get a direct answer and really work to solve it. </p>
